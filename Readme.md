# NOTE
This is a beta for now. It is possible that it causes crashes, bugs or similiar. I'm not responsible if you lose progress in your game or anything else :BabyRage:


# About
CommandInjector is a little NamedPipe-based "API" DLL-Plugin written in C++ for Borderlands 2 and Borderlands TPS.

This is only useful to developers. This is **NOT** going to do anything on it's own.

If you want to know how to utilize it from C#, look at the Project in this repo, the "Needed Code.txt" in the Zip-File or 
you can also use/look at mopioid's [BLIO](https://github.com/mopioid/BLIO).

# Requirements
- [PluginLoader](https://github.com/c0dycode/BorderlandsPluginLoader)


# Current Features
- Sending Commands to the game and receive ConsoleOutput
- Get LevelTransitionData (From Map -> To Map) (Currently in Testing)

# Projects utilizing CommandInjector
- [BorderlandsReadOnlyDetector](https://github.com/FromDarkHell/BorderlandsReadOnlyDetector)
- [Borderlands-Chatbot](https://github.com/mopioid/Borderlands-Chatbot)
- You tell me :P

# Having issues?
Feel free to open up a new issue. 
If you believe CommandInjector caused the game to crash, check if you have a "CommandInjector.dmp" in your Win32-folder and if so, send it to me.

# Special thanks to
- mopioid for testing, working with and enjoying it
- FromDarkHell for testing and having issues :BabyRage:
